Assignment 16 - A Google Books Search and Save React-based App

## Overview Description
Homework Assignment 16 - Google Books Search
SMU Programming Bootcamp Spring 2019

### Overview

The purpose of this assignment is to create a React-based Google Books Search app. This assignment uses React components, works with helper/util functions, and utilizes React lifecycle methods to query and display books based on user searches. It also uses Node, Express and MongoDB so that users can save books to review or purchase later.

My working app can be found on Heroku [here](https://enigmatic-headland-97665.herokuapp.com/)

### Using the App
The Home/Search Page allows the user to enter the title of a book to search for using Google Books. A list of books, including author, a book description, and a book image is displayed. The user has the option of saving a book in a database by clicking the 'Save' button. Or the user can view more detailed information about a book by clicking it's title.

The Saved Books Page allows the user to see their saved books. The user has the option of deleting a book from the database by clicking the 'Delete' button. Or the user can view more detailed information about a book by clicking it's title.

### Node Packages Used
The following packages are needed (npm install 'pkg name') to run the app

   * [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)

   * [Mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose)

   * [React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react)
   
   * [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios)
